## TASK MANAGER
### This is a basic program to keep track of tasks and users
### Description 
Task Manager was designed to simplify the tracking of tasks .The program allows users to add new tasks, add new users, edit and complete tasks, display statistics and generate
reports in an easy to view format for all tasks. The initial program has an admin username and password, which is used to add additional users and tasks. Once additional users
have been added they too can add tasks, view and edit tasks and display statistics. The program writes all the user input to text files which are saved seperately. 
For privacy, all users are required to login to the program before they can access any information.
